# targeted-demographics to increase voter engagement in EU 2019 vote

We came together at a hackathon to use data to improve voter engagement for the 2019 EU election. (more details after the election)

## Data sources and key files (in `/data`)

**TODO** Can everyone please add some notes about the files they added (including - original location, a sentence or two about the data (e.g. year, intention, any issues or thoughts you have), whether this was an input file to a process or an output file from some of our code) please.

## How to run the code

**TODO** can anyone who wrote code please note the high-level process. The goal would be to let one of us (or a likeminded soul) follow the flow of code and data in e.g. 6 months time - so add enough detail to assume that we've forgotten everything and need some nudges in the right direction please.
